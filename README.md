## Online Shopping Cart

>My personal project for CPSC 210 is an **online shopping cart**. This application will be similar to 
any online shopping website where you can order items online. Users will be able to add and remove 
items of their choice to the cart, and apply or remove discounts to items in their cart. There will
also be an option to add items that are out of stock onto a wishlist. Users should be able to reorder
their cart, as well as see the total price of all the items in the cart. 

>Anyone who likes to shop, or needs to order something online that is not available in store
can use this application. In fact, anyone will be able to try out this online shopping cart. 
I chose to create a shopping cart because now more than ever, online shopping has become 
a new normal for many people around the world. I use online shopping services all the time, and 
thought that it would be interesting to design my own. I am also interested in seeing if there are
any cool features that I could add to my online shopping cart that is unique an authentic.
